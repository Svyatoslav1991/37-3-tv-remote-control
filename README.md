Task 3. TV remote control
What should be done
Implement a simple TV control simulator using a remote control presented in the form of a graphical interface with buttons.

The interface is a vertical window (in portrait orientation) measuring 240x680 pixels.
On the remote control there are buttons for switching channels from 0 to 9, buttons for moving to the next and previous channel, buttons for increasing and decreasing the volume in 10% increments.

At the bottom of the remote control there is a mini-display showing the current status: the currently selected channel and the current volume level in percentage.

What is being assessed
Completeness of the graphical interface and correct implementation of the program logic and all buttons.
